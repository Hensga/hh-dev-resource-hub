            Discover a place where you can find the most important resources for
            your work in design and development, curated and organized just for
            you. I decided to start this project to help both you and me.
            I&apos;ve spent countless hours online finding cool tools and
            websites, only to lose track of them with laptop changes and browser
            profile switches. With this site, that won&apos;t happen anymore.
            Just one link to remember to have all your resources in one place.
